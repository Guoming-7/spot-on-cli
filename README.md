fastSPT
-------

This repository collects a series of scripts to analyze data from single particle tracking experiments. The code was initially written by Anders Sejr Hansen and translated to Python by Maxime Woringer.

This repository only includes the commandline analysis pipeline. A graphical user interface (GUI) is available for a more user-friendly analysis, but is not included in this repository.

Although the functions and methods can be called directly, we provide a walk-through tutorial as a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook.
